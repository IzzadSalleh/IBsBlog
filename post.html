          <p>Who doesn’t love street markets? It doesn’t matter where you travel, you’re almost guaranteed to stumble upon one. They’re filled with colorful trinkets, local food, and ultimately a loud and abrasive salesperson trying to sell you something overpriced. What’s amazing to me though, is anywhere you visit--Taiwan, Italy, Israel, Madagascar, Spain, Costa Rica--they’ve all got them, and they’re all vastly different. I believe that some of the most accurate representations of daily life in a foreign country can be observed in the street markets. Just make sure to come early in the day, because that’s when the real action takes place.</p>

          <p>You’ve probably heard of some of the famous ones: La Boqueria in Barcelona, The Shook in Jerusalem, Le Mercerie in Venice, and The Ferry Building in San Francisco. Each of which hold interesting trinkets, foods and local representation, and yet remain as different from one another as the cultures they represent. Even the smaller markets, a night market in Taiwan, produce stands in France and Italy, and the unnamed markets in hundreds of cities, possess a spirit that is unlike any other monument or landmark you may visit.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">FERRY PLAZA SUNDAY MARKET - SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA</h2>

          <p>Primarily a spot for tourists to glimpse some of the most famous elements of the San Francisco food scene--think: Sourdough Bread, Organic Foods, Coffee, Ice Cream--this market is a hit year-round. Saturday's are the “big” day. There are quite a few stands outside the ferry building boasting local produce, photography and trinkets. However, on the weekdays the Ferry Building is still open to the public and houses some of the authentic SF restaurants. Locals who work in the Financial District frequently pop inside to grab a steamed pork bun, coffee, or fresh seafood during their lunch break!</p>

          <p>Iceland is famous for many things: Geothermal energy, glaciers, volcanoes, ponies, large men with beards, being greener than Greenland, and of course WATERFALLS. These waterfalls or foss in Icelandic are some of the most stunning I've ever seen. Within the 40,000 square miles of Iceland there are over 10,000 waterfalls--that's one every 4 miles! And these aren't the pipsqueak waterfalls you occasionally pass while driving (aka rain run-off or snow melt), these babies are big, powerful and beautiful.</p>

          <p>The best way to view a large number of waterfalls if you are staying in Iceland is to use the Ring Road, as most of the big ones fall in its path.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Öxarárfoss -  Öxará River</h2>

          <p>Starting out small. This waterfall is part of the Þingvellir National Park which sits directly on the fault line between Eurasia and North American tectonic plates.</p>

            </div>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Gullfoss - Hvítá River</h2>

          <p>One of the most powerful waterfalls in Iceland, this one was particularly impressive to me. You can walk down a steep path and onto a rock that juts out in the middle of the falls, with extremely fast moving water on three sides. The lack of “red tape” in places outside the United States never fails to amaze me. In the US getting close to a waterfall of that magnitude would NEVER happen.</p>

          <p>Iceland is also famous for its mythology and legends, and legend of Gullfoss doesn’t disappoint. This river supposedly separated two families. It is said that a man and woman lived on either side, and throughout the course of their youth they fell in love from a distance. They were desperate to be united and marry. However, because of the strong current of the Hvítá River and Gullfoss looming in the distance the lovers were prevented from reaching each other. One day the man had had enough, he braved the freezing rushing currents and swam desperately across the river to be united with his love. He made it and they lived happily together from then on, on her side of the river.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Skógafoss - Skógá River</h2>

          <p>Skógafoss is one of the most powerful and beautiful waterfalls in Iceland. There are quite a few legends surrounding the giant falls!</p>

          <p>Legend 1: The most common is that one of the first vikings in the area hid a treasure chest of gold behind the falls. It was rumored that a young boy found the chest but that it was too heavy for him to bring back so we removed one of the rings from the side. He reportedly gave the ring to a local church for safe keeping.</p>

          <p>Legend 2: Iceland is famous for its mythological legends alongside it’s tales of vikings and treasure. This particular legend states that there were two trolls wandering through the countryside. The larger of the two was holding the smaller troll on his shoulders. Once they happened upon Skógafoss they were stunned by the waterfalls beauty. They remained frozen there watching the waterfall for so long that they turned to stone. They can be seen on the east side of the waterfall, as stone, watching the waterfall for ever more.</p>
